# ECMA-55 BASIC translations for the Korean language
#
# ECMA-55 can be found at the "Download this standard" button
# at the bottom of
# https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-55/
#
# please forgive me for any errors. i am not
# a native Korean speaker.  these translations
# came from a third party database.
#
# i am certain some of these are embarrassingly wrong,
# and i apologize.
#
# i am also certain some of the longer ones can
# probably be shortened.
#
# this is not the final release file.  this file
# was simply used for testing, because i needed a
# non Latin based script.
