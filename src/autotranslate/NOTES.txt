workflow:

(1) upload polybasic.ods to google sheets
(2) make changes
(3) download as *.ods
(4) download as *.tsv
(5) run make

The polybasic.ods file should be the PRIMARY source for translations.
It should be downloaded as polybasic.tsv so the automated tools can read it.
Let the automated tools take it from there.
