workflow:

(1) upload polybasic.ods to google sheets
(2) make changes on lang_* pages
    make sure there are no duplicates (orange highlinging in column A)
(3) download the polybasic.txv sheet as a *.tsv
(4) download the work as *.ods
(5) run make

The order is important.  If you download the *.ods first, all the calls
to google translate get redone, which takes time, and introduces errors.
(lots of things translated as "Loading...")

The polybasic.ods file should be the PRIMARY source for translations.
It should be downloaded as polybasic.tsv so the automated tools can
read it.  Let the automated tools take it from there.
