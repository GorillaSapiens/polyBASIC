the originals are what you might expect as a product of the times... a
set of pictures of some printed document. *ugh*

the *ocr.pdf is an attempt at running it through an Optical Character
Recognition program, so at least we can search it.

the *ocr.txt is an attempt to format it as a text file.

the last two are automated, and unedited by humans, so they will have
the expected problems.  maybe at some point someone will get around to
actually cleaning them up.

General procedure for converting these old PDFs to something useful:
% ocrmypdf ECMA-NNN_whatever.pdf ECMA-NNN_ocr.pdf
% pdftotext -layout ECMA-NNN_ocr.pdf
