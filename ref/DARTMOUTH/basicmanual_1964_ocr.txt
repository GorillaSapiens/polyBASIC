Recently, when going through some of my early BASIC files, I came
across this first edition of our original Instruction Manual which
was used at Dartmouth College in 1964.

 I was stuck by the simplicity of our first efforts, but also, just how
 much of the original implementation is still used as it was those very
first months of BASIC"s existence.
I hope you enjoy this facsimile of that early document.                                                                             Instruction         Manu al

                     A variable                           in BASIC is any single letter,   or                                             a   letter
               followed by one                            digit.  E.g.:  A, X, N5, XO, KQ.

                           There              are also variables  for vectors                                           and    matrices,                but
               these        will              be discussed only in Part II.

              BASIC.   The symbols +,+, *, / stand for addition,     subtrac-
              tion,  multiplication,  and division.   Raising a quantity to
              a power is indicated by an upwards arrow.      Since on a tele~
              type typewriter it is impossible    to print superscripts,
              austead               of    x?        we     write     xXf2.           However,               if     we     want       to       compute

              that     ATB           is        actually            interpreted                  as        [a[2-

             ATN(X)            is        the        inverse         tangent            function.

             SOR(A)            stands               for (A,         where        the       square-root                    is    always         taken
