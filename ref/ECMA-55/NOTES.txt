the original 1st_edition_january_178.pdf is what you might expect as a
product of the times... a set of pictures of some printed document. *ugh*

the ocr.pdf is an attempt at running it through an Optical Character
Recognition program, so at least we can search it.

the ocr.txt is an attempt to format it as a text file.

the last two were automated, and unedited by humans, so they will have
the expected problems.  maybe at some point someone will get around to
actually cleaning them up.
