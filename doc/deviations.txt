addition of unicode, obviously

support for multiple translations

backslashes are now allowed as escape characters inside string constants,
so you can include " inside a string. apostrophies are no longer allowed
as character delimeters, and "" is not a valid " escape.

:= for assignment, == for comparison. "=" is no longer valid.  this was done
to eliminate a class of errors where people got "=" and "==" confused.

line labels are optional, and need not be numeric, or even in numeric
order.  lines are executed in order, and labels are used solely as targets
for GOTO, GOSUB, and ON statements.  nonnumeric labels must end in a ":",
and cannot match (translated) keywords.
