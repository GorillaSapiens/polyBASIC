addition of unicode, obviously

support for multiple translations

backslashes are now allowed as escape characters inside string constants,
so you can include " inside a string. apostrophies are no longer allowed
as string delimeters, and "" is not a valid " escape.  use backslashes
for escapes.

:= for assignment, == for comparison. "=" is no longer valid.  this was
done to eliminate a class of errors where people got "=" and "=="
confused.

both <> and != are accepted for "not equal" comparisons.  they are
completely equivalent.

relational comparisons between string values follow C strcmp semantics.

line labels are optional, and need not be numeric, or even in numeric
order.  lines are executed in order, and labels are used solely as
targets for GOTO, GOSUB, and ON statements.  nonnumeric labels cannot
match (translated) keywords.

introduction of the "rational" type, in addition to integers, numbers,
and strings.  the begin sigil for a rational type is '#'.  the rational
number "negative 4 and 2/3" would be written "#-4'2/3".  rational maths
result in the lowest necessary denominator.

introduction of "ON <equality> GOSUB" because it seemed easy to do

dimensioned variables have been dropped.  they may be implemented later.
