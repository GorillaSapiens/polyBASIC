(*) addition of unicode, obviously

(*) support for multiple translations

(*) backslashes are now allowed as escape characters inside string
constants, so you can include " inside a string. apostrophies are no
longer allowed as string delimeters, and "" is not a valid " escape.
use backslashes for escapes.

(*) := for assignment, == for comparison. "=" is no longer valid.
this was done to eliminate a class of errors where people got "=" and
"==" confused.  the "LET" keyword is completely optional.

(*) both <> and != are accepted for "not equal" comparisons.  they are
completely equivalent.

(*) relational comparisons (<, <=, >, >=) between string values follow
C strcmp semantics.

(*) line labels are optional, and need not be numeric, or even in
numeric order.  lines are executed in order, and labels are used solely
as targets for GOTO, GOSUB, and ON statements.  nonnumeric labels cannot
match (translated) keywords.

(*) introduction of the "rational" type, in addition to integers,
numbers, and strings.  the begin sigil for a rational type is '#'.
the rational number "negative 4 and 2/3" would be written "#-4'2/3".
rational maths result in the lowest necessary denominator.

(*) introduction of "ON <expresssion> GOSUB" because it seemed easy to do

(*) keywords are case insensitive

(*) DEF function names are unrestricted, and may have any number of
parameters, but you must use square braces "[" and "]" when defining and
calling them.  parameters are not required, although square braces are
still required when defining or calling, even if there are no parameters.
Circular dependencies in DEF functions are not allowed.

(*) both uppercase and lowercase "e" are allowed in numbers.
