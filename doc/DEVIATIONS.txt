This document details differences from various other forms of BASIC.

(*) addition of unicode, obviously

(*) support for multiple translations

(*) backslashes are now allowed as escape characters inside string
constants, so you can include " inside a string. apostrophies are no
longer allowed as string delimeters, and "" is not a valid " escape.
use backslashes for escapes.

(*) relational comparisons (<, <=, >, >=) between string values follow
C strcmp semantics.

(*) line labels are optional, and need not be numeric, or even in
numeric order.  lines are executed in order, and labels are used solely
as targets for GOTO, GOSUB, and ON statements.  nonnumeric labels cannot
match (translated) keywords.

(*) introduction of the "rational" type, in addition to integers,
numbers, and strings.  the begin sigil for a rational type is '#'.
the rational number "negative 4 and 2/3" would be written "#-4'2/3".
rational maths result in the lowest necessary denominator.

(*) introduction of "ON <expresssion> GOSUB" because it seemed easy to do

(*) keywords are case insensitive

(*) both uppercase and lowercase "e" are allowed in numbers.

(*) C-64ish ":" allows multiple statements per line

(*) many other C-64isms
