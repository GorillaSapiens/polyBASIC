(*) What is polyBASIC?

polyBASIC is an attempt to implement a BASIC compiler / interpreter
that can be easily reconfigured with keywords in any human language,
allowing anyone to write in a BASIC-like computer language, but in their
native tongue.

(*) Why would you want to do that?

Most computer programming languages are based on English.  While many
people in the world speak English, it is only natively spoken as a first
language by about half a billion people, and only about 1.1 billion speak
it as a second language.  This leaves, roughly, 6.5 billion people who
speak no English at all.

(*) What is ECMA-55?

ECMA-55 is European Computer Manufacturers Association Standard #55.
It was published in 1978, and specifies a minimal version of the BASIC
programming language.

(*) Why choose something so simple?  Aren't there better languages?

In the late 70s and early 80s, many students with no computer knowledge at
all learned to program on machines like the Apple ][ or the Commodore-64,
both of which ran very simple versions of the BASIC programming language.

This project is a proof of concept.  We're not sure if this can even be
done at all, and we want to explore some of the concepts, technologies,
and difficulties behind implementing a reconfigurable multilingual
programming language.

There is little question in the computer industry that there are better
computer languages than BASIC.  The issue is to get young people
interested in the concepts behind computers and computer languages,
even before they start learning English, if indeed they ever do.
