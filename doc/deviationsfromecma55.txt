addition of unicode, obviously

support for multiple translations

backslashes are now allowed as escape characters inside string constants,
so you can include " inside a string.

:= for assignment, == for comparison. "=" is no longer valid............

line labels are optional, and need not be numeric, or even in numeric
order.  nonnumeric labels must end in a ":", and cannot match (translated)
keywords.
